Array Notes

Arrays are just like objects.

obj = {
	key: value
}

1. all keys are sequential integers
2. have a different instantiation pattern
3. properties and methods for working with sequential keys

length property
have methods


Method: function attached to an object

Iterating through arrays

for (var i=0; i < array.length; i++){
	console.log(array[i]);
}

shift is pop from the front.

unshift is push from the front (push to front)

Arrays are pass by reference, so you've got a few things pointing to the same object in memory that can screw up the object

Array.concat does not change the original two arrays. It creates a new array in memory.
